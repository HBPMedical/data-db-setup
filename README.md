# Setup for database 'data-db'

## Introduction

This project uses Flyway to manage the database migration scripts for the 'research-db' database used by MIP.

This database contains the data used for reference, including:

* the features (values) for each Common Data Elements (CDE) defined by MIP.

## Usage

Run:

```console
$ docker run -i -t --rm -e FLYWAY_HOST=`hostname` hbpmip/data-db-setup:2.0.0 migrate
```

where the environment variables are:

* FLYWAY_HOST: database host, default to 'db'.
* FLYWAY_PORT: database port, default to 5432.
* FLYWAY_DATABASE_NAME: name of the database or schema, default to 'data'
* FLYWAY_URL: JDBC url to the database, constructed by default from FLYWAY_DBMS, FLYWAY_HOST, FLYWAY_PORT and FLYWAY_DATABASE_NAME
* FLYWAY_DRIVER: Fully qualified classname of the jdbc driver (autodetected by default based on flyway.url)
* FLYWAY_USER: database user, default to 'data'.
* FLYWAY_PASSWORD: database password, default to 'data'.
* FLYWAY_SCHEMAS: Optional, comma-separated list of schemas managed by Flyway
* FLYWAY_TABLE: Optional, name of Flyway's metadata table (default: schema_version)
* DATASETS: column-separated list of datasets to load. Each dataset should have a descriptor defined as a Java properties file (&lt;dataset&gt;.properties) located in a jar under eu.humanbrainproject.mip.migrations package.
